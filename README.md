Team Rocket's Cæléstis Submission for NASA SpaceApps Challenge 2015

### THERE AIN'T NO 911 ON MARS ###

In the challenging environments that are found on Mars, extended stays on ISS, asteroid missions, or even the more humble North Pole here on Earth, sometimes medical emergencies can happen. In preparing to confront those hostile conditions, current and future explorers need to have the supplies and tools available to them to which allow them to survive and thrive.

Team Rocket’s Cæléstis modifications to current NASA medical kits, recommendations for additional supplies to take, novel 3D printed medical devices, and an in-depth discussion on optimizing what current and future explorers take with them is presented here in full, Open Sourced (MIT License), and available for anyone to interact with, or improve.

Thank you,
Team Rocket

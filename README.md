#### Team Rocket's Cæléstis Submission for NASA SpaceApps Challenge 2015

### THERE AIN'T NO 911 ON MARS

In the challenging environments that are found on Mars, extended stays on ISS, asteroid missions, or even the more humble South Pole here on Earth, sometimes medical emergencies can happen. In preparing to confront those hostile conditions, current and future explorers need to have the supplies and tools available to them to which allow them to survive and thrive.

Team Rocket’s Cæléstis modifications to current NASA medical kits, recommendations for additional supplies to take, novel 3D printed medical devices, and an in-depth discussion on optimizing what current and future explorers take with them is presented here in full, Open Sourced (MIT License), and available for anyone to interact with, or improve.

## Current Astromed

Current astromed relies on a series of packaged medical instruments split by general procedure into rollable designs. These rolls stack into a box which itself is then stored on a shelf in the ISS. There are two concrete problems with this setup. One is the medical devices themselves are not always optimized for the future of space travel, and the other is the storage system is bulky and also non-ideal.

### Medical Devices

Current devices are mostly all single use, single purpose, non-recyclable traditional Earth-based designs. What you have in space, is what you took there from Earth. Lastly, these devices don't always follow best current medical practices for emergency situations.

#### 3D Printing (In Space)!

In space we can actually create, or replace many medical devices by using 3D printers. During our exploration of these printers, we realized that they have a few critical advantages that make them ideal for space medicine. Most importantly, they have the ability to recycle the devices by re-melting them, and in the process STERILIZING them. The advantages here are clear; every kilogram of weight, and cubic meter of space is precious on a launch vehicle, and having the ability to re-print the needed medical device on-demand as many times as required while sterilizing it automatically in-between prints provides the future space explorer with a crucial mechanism to survive when the limited supply of medical devices that they brought along runs low.

Other changes and advantages that we can envision with 3D printing in space is the standardization of common tools and device handles that are used by the astronaut, the significant weight and packing advantages of just bringing along the non-printable parts, as well as the ability to create or modify a tool for almost any hostile environment.

To capitalize on the possibilities of 3D printing, Cæléstis is introducing a few novel designs that can be created on the ISS, a mission to Mars, or in a remote location on Earth. The first is a novel syringe specically crafted for 0g ()

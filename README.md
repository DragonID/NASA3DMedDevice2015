#### Team Rocket's Cæléstis Submission for NASA SpaceApps Challenge 2015

### THERE AIN'T NO 911 ON MARS

In the challenging environments that are found on Mars, extended stays on ISS, asteroid missions, or even the more humble South Pole here on Earth, sometimes medical emergencies can happen. In preparing to confront those hostile conditions, current and future explorers need to have the supplies and tools available to them to which allow them to survive and thrive.

Team Rocket’s Cæléstis modifications to current NASA medical kits, recommendations for additional supplies to take, novel 3D printed medical devices, and an in-depth discussion on optimizing what current and future explorers take with them is presented here in full, Open Sourced (MIT License), and available for anyone to interact with, or improve.

You can find more information in the detailed write-up below, on our website [caelestis.space] (http://caelestis.space).

## Current Astromed

Current astromed relies on a series of packaged medical instruments split by general procedure into rollable designs. These rolls stack into a box which itself is then stored on a shelf in the ISS. There are two concrete problems with this setup. One is the medical devices themselves are not always optimized for the future of space travel, and the other is the storage system is bulky and also non-ideal.

### Medical Devices

Current devices are mostly all single use, single purpose, non-recyclable traditional Earth-based designs. What you have in space, is what you took there from Earth. Lastly, these devices don't always follow best current medical practices for emergency situations.

#### 3D Printing (In Space)!

In space we can actually create, or replace many medical devices by using 3D printers. During our exploration of these printers, we realized that they have a few critical advantages that make them ideal for space medicine. Most importantly, they have the ability to recycle the devices by re-melting them, and in the process STERILIZING them. The advantages here are clear; every kilogram of weight, and cubic meter of space is precious on a launch vehicle, and having the ability to re-print the needed medical device on-demand as many times as required while sterilizing it automatically in-between prints provides the future space explorer with a crucial mechanism to survive when the limited supply of medical devices that they brought along runs low.

Other changes and advantages that we can envision with 3D printing in space is the standardization of common tools and device handles that are used by the astronaut, the significant weight and packing advantages of just bringing along the non-printable parts, as well as the ability to create or modify a tool for almost any hostile environment.

To capitalize on the possibilities of 3D printing, Cæléstis is introducing a few novel designs that can be created on the ISS, a mission to Mars, or in a remote location on Earth. The first is a [novel syringe specially crafted for 0g] (https://github.com/DragonID/NASA3DMedDevice2015/blob/master/Scalpel%20writeup.docx). The 3D files, in-use video, and renders can be found [here] (https://github.com/DragonID/NASA3DMedDevice2015/tree/master/Scalpel%203D%20Files) The second is a [modified scalpel] (https://github.com/DragonID/NASA3DMedDevice2015/blob/master/Scalpel%20writeup.docx), which is also optimized for challenging environments. Its 3D files and renders, can be found [here] (https://github.com/DragonID/NASA3DMedDevice2015/tree/master/Scalpel%203D%20Files).

During our research, and using the current [CHeCS reference guide] (http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20110022379.pdf) and [CHeCS IMS] (https://www.nasa.gov/externalflash/ISSRG/pdfs/crewhealth.pdf) we have identified a number of devices that could be 3D printed in addition to the ones we've already modified. These can be found [here] (https://github.com/DragonID/NASA3DMedDevice2015/blob/master/List%20of%203D%20Printable%20Candidate%20Devices.docx), and include many that would provide a significant weight and space advantage if they are included in smaller quantities on lift-off, after which they could be printed when needed.

We have also identified a list of devices that are NOT currently on the list that we strongly believe should be added. This is based on our group's knowledge of emergency medical medicine, as well as some trends identified during the last 10-20 years of combat medicine. This list, and the visual representations of those devices can be found [here] (https://github.com/DragonID/NASA3DMedDevice2015/blob/master/Other%20Suggested%20Kit%20Items.docx).

### Device Storage

Current storage practices rely on very bulky (physically large 66 x 35.6 x 20.3cm and heavy 16.34kg) medical kits that are loaded with microkits for various procedures. These kits are compartmentalized based on kit similarity, rather than procedure or emergency need. These kits are single-purpose, non-reusable, non-ergonomic boxes or roll-cases which easily float away in microgravity environments. Lastly, they optimize a non-ideal packing method that is very wasteful for space or remote Earth environments.

#### Packing for Spacetravel

Cæléstis is proposing a new assembly to be taken to space which addresses these issues. It starts with packing a lower overall number of 'starter' devices that can be later re-created in space based on immediate needs. We then propose packing a large number of metal and ceramic parts that can be attached to the 3D printed handles and tools. Finally, a chosen 3D base material in solid blocks will be added to the payload. These will be packed in with the 3D printer, the high-temperature material recycler, and the UV sterilizer (mentioned in the list of additional medical devices above).

The actual medical storage case itself has also been significantly modified, and updated, based on an optimized flip-open (i.e. origami) design. This allows us to optimize packing and storage of the individual medical kits, and to re-form them based on acute medical conditions that might be encountered in space. Our design allows easy access to kits, while providing tight geometric packing, a secure mechanism when opened for fastening to existing Velcro strips on walls, as well as the ability to utilize the box itself for creating a bandage if the need arises. The 3D files, video during use, and renders can be found [here] (https://github.com/DragonID/NASA3DMedDevice2015/tree/master/Case%203D%20Files). The detailed write-up of the advantages can be found [here] ().
